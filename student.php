		<h1>Student</h1>
		<p>I have had an unusual education, to say the least. A penchant for computing and natural ability in mathematics has made me a formidable student. Despite this, I did not directly pursue a degree as many would expect, instead focusing on moving through several workplaces before beginning a degree through Open University. They allow me the flexibility and freedom to move around, change workloads, and take my time to achieve what I want to. You can read more more about my work in my <a href="resume">Résumé</a>.</p>
