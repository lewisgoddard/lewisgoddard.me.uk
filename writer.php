		<p><a href="http://coffeebeansandotherlies.com/">Coffee Beans and other Lies</a> is the ground-breaking new expos√© from Lewis Goddard, brutally debunking everything from common misconceptions, to downright porkies.</p>
		<p>With over 100 hundred Myths, Lies, Legends and Misconceptions, this book is surely a must have for any self-respecting human being.</p>
		<p>Coffee Beans and other Lies is not limited by mundane things, such as references, or, indeed, taste. In fact, the entire book is basically a list of things you've been ignorant about for the preceding portion of our life.</p>
		<h4>Lies, Misconceptions, Myths and Urban Legends.</h4>
		<p>Coffee Beans don't exist. Orange does have a rhyme. Oh, and the British certainly don't have bad teeth.</p>
		<p>Penguins aren't as romantic as the hipsters made out, there have really been a fair few Polish geniuses, and the French have better records than some heavyweight champions. Intrigued yet? Stockbrokers don't know what they're doing, and neither do Weather People.</p>
		<p>Still think there are 50 States in the USA?</p>
